	// Place your snippets for go here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"describe block": {
		"prefix": "d",
		"body": [
			"Describe(\"$1\", func() {\n",
			"\t$2\n",
			"})"
		],
	},
	"describe block": {
		"prefix": "it",
		"body": [
			"It(\"$1\", func() {\n",
			"\t$2\n",
			"})"
		],
	}
